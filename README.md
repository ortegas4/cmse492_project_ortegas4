# The better fantasy football projector (BFFP)

The Better Fantasy Football Projector (BFFP) is a machine learning project designed to more accurately predict fantasy football performance by incorporating key offensive metrics. The model leverages player statistics such as targets, receptions, passing yards, and fumbles lost to estimate weekly fantasy point outcomes with higher precision than standard projections. Using regression-based learning techniques, BFFP identifies trends in player efficiency and usage patterns to produce data-driven forecasts that help fantasy managers make smarter lineup and trade decisions. As of now no dependencies are needed apart from a regular python enviroment but, as the project progresses this will be updated.
